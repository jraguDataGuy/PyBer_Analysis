# PyBer Analysis of Fares by Type of City
## Overview
We recently completed an analysis of our ride sharing data that helped draw conclusions on fares by city type. We wanted to get a different view point of the ride share data and break it down by volumes, averages, and rivers by type of cities

A few conclusions can be made with this data:
- As expected, our highest amount of fares come from our Urban cities. This is a reasonable expectation given the population density.
- The highest average fares come from our less populated city types, likely given suburban/rural sprawl would increase distance travel per ride
- We have a very large workforce to server our urban customers. 
## Ride-Share Analysis of fares by Month

For this analysis, we looked at total fares by month for the 3 distinct types of cities. A few things pop out in our visualization:
- All 3 city types had very similar peaks and valleys in rides.
- The differnce between the 3 remains the disparity in dollars expected to be seen by the type of city.

## Conclusions and Additional Study Plans
Ultimately, we would want to find a few more details to make further conclusions. For example, what events in the territories peak the fares for all 3 classified cities? In addition, would an increased drive base in the rural territories drive down average fare price, or is there not enough demand to support the drivers.
